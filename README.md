# GAandPIR
Graduation Assignment (GA) and Innovation and Research Project (PIR).

The purpose of this project is to develop a mental workload classifier for real-time crew monitoring using machine learning algorithm. The programming language used was Python and Matlab.

The input data are features related to the individual's eye movement and cardiac activity, detected by an eye tracker and an ECG chest band. From this, the aim is to use supervised machine learning methods to classify the mental workload as Low, Medium or High.
